          <p> You're a garden on my hard pavement&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You're the air, giving life,</p>
            <p> You might feel polluted, wild and wasted,</p>
            <p>And maybe it's the reason you stay up at night.</p>
            <p> <br>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You're the flower blooming on my heart of concrete,</p>
            <p> You're the ray of sun, giving light,</p>
            <p> You might feel abused, hated and not worth it,</p>
            <p> But don't let it make you stay up all night,</p>
            <p> <br>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cause here i'm gonna show you what you can't see,</p>
          <p>Just the thoughts of you are driving me crazy,</p>
          <p>You're making me see rainbows in the night sky,</p>
          <p>And I swear it's only your Love and not some Drug-High.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Let me fill it with every colour</p>
            <p>The world that you've designed, for both of our eyes,</p>
            <p>We're making a living art,</p>
            <p>here my dream ends,</p>
            <p>and it breaks my heart.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Don't you stay up all night,</p>
            <p>Cause even if you hurt me,</p>
            <p>to me you're worth it !</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I need you and I mean it,</p>
            <p>I would still spend every minute of my time with you,</p>
            <p>For better or worse or even if i'm wasting.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I'm falling for you and I mean it,</p>
            <p>There's nothing that could change my mind,</p>
            <p>and it's nothing new,</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You already know,</p>
            <p>I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To others you may seem like a mysterious secret,</p>
          <p>To me, you're an open book</p>
            <p>and there's nothing in it that I won't accept,</p>
            <p>Or ever let the pages fall through.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You know what I want,</p>
            <p>I wanna know who you are,</p>
            <p>I wanna hold you and love you,</p>
            <p>and never let you fall apart.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So don't you go and ever hide yourself,</p>
            <p>Cause even if you hurt me,</p>
            <p>to me you're worth it !</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Call me when you want me and i'll come running,</p>
            <p>You'll find me waiting for you outside your door</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you're lonely, it won't last long,</p>
            <p>Cause I'm in love with you and it's only gonna keep on burning more.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So if you ever get doubts,</p>
            <p>Throw them out,</p>
